# OpenGraph
This will become an open source project... not quite ready but here is the current version:

https://rawgit.com/johnRedden/OpenGraph/master/opengraph.html

This project is based on JSXGraph: 
http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/

JSXGraph Reference: http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/docs/index.html

JSXGraph Notes:
// JSXgraph setProperty has been depreciated...TODO replace everywhere
// Use setAttribute and getAttribute
(currEntry[0].graphRef).setAttribute({ strokeWidth: n });
(currEntry[0].graphRef).getAttribute('strokeWidth');
